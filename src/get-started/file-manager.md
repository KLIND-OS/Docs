# File manager

KLIND OS has its own file manager. It is written in JavaScript and works a little differently than the Windows file manager

## Technical Specifications

All data is stored in 'usrfiles'.

## Differences from Windows File Manager

There is no recycle bin in KLIND OS. If you delete something, it's gone forever.

The path does not start with `C:/` but always with `/`. This is called the `root folder'.

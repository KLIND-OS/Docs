# Introduction

## About KLIND OS

KLIND OS is an [Arch Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux) [distribution](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linuxov%C3%A1_distribution) built on [Electron]( https://electronjs.org) and Javascript.

## Who is KLIND OS for?

KLIND OS is not for normal users. Please stay under a big corporation (Microsoft / Apple) who will build the whole system for you and you don't have to worry about anything. The problem with this is that you have no privacy. You don't know what Microsoft has put into Windows that can track you.

## Why KLIND OS exists

KLIND OS is an operating system that wants to show that everything can be done with JavaScript. That's why I wrote the entire graphical interface, filemanager and a lot of other things in JavaScript.

## KLIND OS is not perfect

There are a lot of bugs in KLIND OS and there is also poor support for the Internet, printers and other devices. If you are good enough with Linux setup, you will be able to do everything in KLIND OS that you can do in Linux.

## There is no team of people working on KLIND OS

Only [me](https://jzitnik.dev) works on KLIND OS. That's why I'm not correcting all the mistakes and doing what the big corporations have. I accept pull requests if anyone wants.

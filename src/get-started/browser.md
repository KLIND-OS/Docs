# Browser

KLIND OS has its own fully functional browser

## Technical Specifications

The browser uses Electron webview.

## Browsing the Internet

I think that's pretty intuitive.

## Downloading from the Internet

If you download a file from the Internet, it will download the file from the root folder.

## Uploading to the Internet

Uploading to the Internet often does not work and is not very good. There is also a problem with encoding and other things.

It's not quite well implemented. If someone wants to, they can fix it and create a pull request.

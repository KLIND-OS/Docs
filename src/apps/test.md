# Testing the application

Now we will test the application that we have programmed.

## Compilation

Run `KLINS-OS-Packager.mjs` and select `Compile application and move to KLIND OS Development` option.

Then select the ``Latest version'' option and let the compilation complete.

Now the application is compiled and moved to KLIND OS Developers. Go to the File Manager in KLIND OS and you will have a compiled application in the root folder.

Install this in the same way as other applications.
